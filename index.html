    <h1>Hello! My name is Shalom Oyewusi</h1>
    <p>I am a second-year Interactive Systems Design student at the University of Saskatchewan. </p>
    <p>As a dedicated and enthusiastic individual with a passion for technology and innovation, I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge to real-world challenges.</p>
    <p>I have developed my skills through practical projects and ongoing education, and I have a strong interest in software development, web development and game development.</p>
    <p>Currently, I am actively looking for a summer internship where I can apply my skills, work with specialists in the field, obtain real-world experience, and hone my skills in a stimulating and demanding setting.</p>
    <p>In my free-time I enjoy playing basketball and played at a high level while representing Team Saskatchewan as the team captain.</p>
    <p>My experiences from basketball have helped me to become a good communicator, good leader, and most importantly it has taught me the importance of teamwork.</p>
    <p>I am currently quite proficient in bulding projects and coding using Python, Java, HTML, and CSS.</p>
    <p>As a person I am always up for a challenge and I am always eager to learn more, because no knowledge is wasted.</p>
